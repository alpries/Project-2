HELP FOR THE FILESYSTEM PROGRAMMING PROJECT
===========================================

This directory is meant to be a helpful starting point for
Programming Project 2 (on filesystems).  The codebase here
is partial, but it already has a great deal of startup and
guiding code!

- Study the xv6 files below --- I have added some comments/pictures.
  The ones with the L prefix have significant modifications.

    Lbio.c Ldiskio.c buf.h fs.h param.h Lstat.h

  The Lbio.c file implements the main buffer cache backend.

- I have provided a pre-compiled binary file:

    Lcli-staticbin

  This will give you an idea of how the CLI interface should work
  once pwd, ls, and cd are implemented.  It can be run on any
  riscv64 linux machine.

- I have stripped code from the main file:

    Lcli.c

  You can start with this, but you will have to add command line
  string/token processing code in it, and use/call filesystem
  helper functions that you will need to implement in the
  walkfunctions.c file, which I have removed.

- You will need to write basic filesystem helper functions
  in walkfunctions.c.  Althoigh it is not provided, I have
  included the header file:

    walkfunctions.h 

  This header file describes the functions in walkfunctions.c.

Happy coding!
